	When using LDAP, User ID (also known as LoginName) is used for authentication. However if you are also letting users authenticate against the database, you can check this box to allow database authentication to work using email address or User ID to make it easier for your non LDAP users so they don't have to remmeber their User ID and can just enter their email address for the User ID on the sign in page.</p>
