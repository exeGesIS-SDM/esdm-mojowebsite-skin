<p>Choose one of these options based on the security requirements for your site. Clear Text is the least secure and most convenient as site admins can see the user password and can easily help a user who forgets their password. Encrypted is the next level site admins can't see the password in a casual way but the data can be decrypted so it is not completely secure. Hashed passwords cannot be decrypted and are the most secure but possibly less conveneient if the user forgets their password it must be reset to a new random password. The user can sign in with the new radom password and change it to something easier to remember.</p>
