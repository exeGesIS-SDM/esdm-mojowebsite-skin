<p>If there is any reason that you do NOT want google or other search engines to index this thread then check this box and this meta element will be added to the head section of the page:</p>

<p>&lt;meta name='robots' content='NOINDEX' /&gt;</p>

<p>This tells search engines not to index the content. Note that simply leaving a thread out of the forum site map does not prevent it from being indexed because google could still crawl the thread even though it is not in the site map. The site map tells google which pages you would like it to crawl but the absence of an url in the site map does not prevent content from being indexed whereas this meta tag will be respected by all major search indexes.</p>
