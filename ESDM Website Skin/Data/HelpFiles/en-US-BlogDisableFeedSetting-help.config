<p>By default an outbound feed is enabled for your blog because blogs are generally published on public pages and encourage subscribers and readership. Feed readers and feeds in general do not provide mechanisms for limiting access to specific users. Its pretty much an all or nothing, you can keep the feed enabled or you can disable it completely. There is no way tio enabled for some users without enabling it for all users. Even if you put your blog on a page protected by roles, if the feed is enabled it will be possible for anyone to view the feed content if they know the feed url. So if you really need some kind of secure blog on a private page, then you should disable the outbound feed.</p>
