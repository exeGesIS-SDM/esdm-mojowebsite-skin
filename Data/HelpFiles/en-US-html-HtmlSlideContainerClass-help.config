<p>This is an advanced setting, you should leave it blank unless you have some understanding of html and can edit using the Html view of the editor.</p>
<p>The purpose of this setting is to make it possible for you to have some content that is not part of the slide show. By default, when this setting is blank, all html elements in the content are treated as slides in the slideshow.</p>
<p>For example if you only want some of the content to be a slide show, you could specify myslides as the CSS class for the slide show container. Then using Html view of the editor wrap a &lt;div class="myslides"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; around the set of elements that you want to be slides. Then only elements within this div will be slides and content outside the divs will be static.</p>
<p>You can even have multiple slideshows with static content between them by creating multiple divs as indicated above.</p>
