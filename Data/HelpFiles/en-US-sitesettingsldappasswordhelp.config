<p>Before you try and switch mojoPortal to use LDAP, you should change your Admin login name to match your LDAP login name, then logout and log back in to the site. Alternatively you can create a new user with a name that exists in the LDAP Directory, make that user a member of the Administrators role, and then login as that user to try and change the site configuration to use LDAP.</p>
<p>For example if you have an LDAP user with the LDAP login frodo, create a user with a login (user id) name of frodo and add him to the Administrators role in mojoPortal, then login as that user to mojoPortal to try and make the change.</p>
<p>You must enter your LDAP password here and mojoPortal will test authenticating you against LDAP. If this test fails you will not be allowed to change the settings to use LDAP. This is to prevent you and other users from getting locked out of the site by this change.</p>
