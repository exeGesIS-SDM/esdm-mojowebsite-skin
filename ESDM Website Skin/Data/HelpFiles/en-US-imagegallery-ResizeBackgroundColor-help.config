<p>
	When images are resized to create web sized and thumbnail sized images from the original, a background color must be used when creating the resized image. This background color can appear as a thin border on the resized image, so it is best to choose a background color that works well with your site's color scheme. By default white is used, but you can specify your preferred background color and it will be used for any new images that you upload. Changing this setting does not affect images that have already been uploaded.</p>
