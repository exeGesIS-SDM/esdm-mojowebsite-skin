<p>Users with edit permissions on the page or forums can update a post to have a sticky sort. Normal posts have a sticky sort of 100, by setting the sticky sort to a number lower than 100 it is possible to make a post sticky, that is to make it sort near the top, the lower the sticky sort number the closer to the top it will be, but any post with a sticky sort lower than 100 will sort higher than normal posts.</p>
