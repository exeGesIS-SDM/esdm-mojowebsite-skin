	By default users can check a "Remember Me" box on the login page and a persistent cookie is used for authentication so that the user doe snot have to login again for each new browser session. However in some cases security needs may require that you not allow this. By un-checking this box the "Remember Me" checkbox will not be shown so users cannot sign in using a persistent cookie. However this setting does not apply to 3rd party sign in systems such as JanRain Engage or Windows Live, it only applies to the direct sign in system.</p>
