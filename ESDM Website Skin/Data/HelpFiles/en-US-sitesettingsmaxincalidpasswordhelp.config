<p>This setting, &quot;Max Invalid Password Attempts&quot;, is used in conjunction with the &quot;Password Attempt Window in Minutes&quot; setting. If the user tries to login with an incorrect password this many times within the specified time window, the user account will be locked. So for example with the default settings, if the user tries to login more than 5 times in 5 minutes without providing the correct password the user account will be locked.</p>
