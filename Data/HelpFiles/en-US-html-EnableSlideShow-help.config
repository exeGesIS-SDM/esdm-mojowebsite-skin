<p>If checked a slideshow will be automatically created from the first level elements in the content. It doesn't matter what the element is it could be a p, a div, an img or anything else as long as it is an immediate child of the content it will be made into a slide. Slides will be rotated using transition effects between each slide.</p>
<p>If you want to make a slide with multiple paragraphs for example you can wrap them in a div using the html view.</p>
