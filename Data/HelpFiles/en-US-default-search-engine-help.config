	You can choose the primary site search engine here. If you choose Bing or Google you must enter the appId&nbsp;or custom search id as required, otherwise it will use the internal search.</p>
<p>
	The advantage of the internal site search is that it can find content on pages protected by roles if the user doing the search is in an allowed role for the content. Public search engines like Bing and Google can only find content on public pages of your site that are not protected by roles.</p>
<p>
	In some cases, if your site consists mainly of public content, public search engines may do a better job of finding things your visitors are looking for. However, keep in mind that Bing and Google Search will only work once your <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com/submitting-your-site-maps-to-google-and-bing.aspx">sitemaps have been submitted to Google and Bing</a> and after they have crawled your site. So for brand new sites it can take a while before these search engines can be used effectively.</p>
