<p>&#160;If you put you company name here and you have the CopyrightLabel control in the layout.master file of your skin, it will display the company name in the copyright notice. If your custom skin does not have the CoprightLabel control, you can add it like this:</p>
<p>&lt;portal:CopyrightLabel ID="cl1" runat="server"   ShowYear="true" BeginYear="2008" /&gt;</p>
