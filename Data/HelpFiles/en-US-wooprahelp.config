<p>Woopra is a web analytics tool, similar in some ways to google analytics but it gives a much better ability to track traffic on your site in real time. You get a good sense of what visitors are doing on your site, what pages they look at and in what sequence. You can see how they arrived at your site, whether by a search engine or a referral from another site or direct url. You can sign up for Woopra at <a href="http://www.woopra.com">http://www.woopra.com</a> and then install the woopra software on your home or office computer and you can monitor your site in real time. There is an approval process before you can use woopra. Once you get notification that your site is approved check this box and the woopra script will automatically be added to each page of your site assuming you have the woopra control in the layout.master file of your skin. Put it at the bottom just before the closing &lt;/form&gt; tag.&#160;</p>
