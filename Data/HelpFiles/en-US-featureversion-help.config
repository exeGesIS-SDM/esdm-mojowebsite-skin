<p>Note that this is not a complete list of installed features. It only shows features that have their own tables in the database (i.e. their own database schema). Some features require no additional tables and therefore have no schema version. Whenever a change is made to the database schema for a feature (i.e. whenever an upgrade script is run for the feature) its schema version is incremented.</p>
