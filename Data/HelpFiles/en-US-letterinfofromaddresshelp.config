<p>You can leave this blank and the site default email address will be used or you can specify an address to send the email from here. Keep in mind that you should generally use the same email address for sending newsletters as what you have for smtp settings. If the from address does not appear to come from the correct server it can appear as spoofing an address and may be flagged as spam by many spam blockers.</p>
