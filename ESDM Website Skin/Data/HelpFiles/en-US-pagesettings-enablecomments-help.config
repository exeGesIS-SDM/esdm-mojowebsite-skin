<p>If you enable comments, then a comments section will be added to the bottom of the center column. Currently only IntenseDebate and Disqus comment systems are implemented. In a future version of mojoPortal CMS we will have an internal comment system as well. Actually there are some issues with Disqus (your mileage may vary) so IntenseDebate is recommended.</p>
<p>In order for comments to work, you have to have an IntenseDebate Account Id entered in Site Settigns under API Keys or a Disqus Short Site Name.</p>
