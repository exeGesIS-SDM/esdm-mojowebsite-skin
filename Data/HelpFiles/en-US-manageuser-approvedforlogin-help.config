	If you have enabled the setting in Site Settings to require approval before new users can sign in, then when new users register they will be marked as not approved by default and they will not be able to sign into the site until you click the Approve button. Note that this is a one time approval process for new users, if you later want to block a user from signing in you can lock the account. The approval button will not be shown again after you approve the user.</p>
