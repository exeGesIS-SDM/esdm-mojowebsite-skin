<p>Enter your Windows Live Messenger Id here to enable the Web Chat control.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get your Windows Live Messenger Id. If Live Messenger is enabled in this site for user profiles, then the easiest way is to go to your profile page by clicking the "My Account" link. Then click the Profile tab, then click the link that says "Acquire/Refresh a Live Messenger Permission Token". After that come back to the page with the Live Messenger Feature on it. It will detect that your user profile has the needed token and a button will appear so you can easily use your token/Messenger Id in this feature.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can visit this url&#160;<a href="http://settings.messenger.live.com/applications/CreateHtml.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0">http://settings.messenger.live.com/applications/CreateHtml.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0</a>, click the "Home" link then you can check the box that says "<span>Allow anyone on the web to see my presence and send me messages." Then click the "Create Html" link and choose IM Window, at the bottom it will show some html with an iframe. The only part you need is the part formated like this: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@apps.messenger.live.com", its the invitee parameter. Enter only this part for the Live Messenger Id. Note that you only want this paramter, you do not paste all the html into thsi setting, just the invitee parameter.</span></p>
