<p>
	&nbsp;Sometimes you may have some content that is meant to be visible ony to anonymous visitors. This settings makes it possible to remove the page from the menu when the user is signed into the site.</p>
<p>
	Note: This is not a security setting, it does not protect the page, it is only a cosmetic setting for hiding pages. If you want to secure the page you should set the View Roles under the Security tab to not allow &quot;All Users&quot;. Pages protected by roles also do not appear in the menu unless the user is in one of the allowed roles. A page that is simply marked as hidden can still be accessed directly or from search results.</p>
