<p>The MyPage feature allows users to create "portal" pages --custom assembled pages containing content instances that you make available for their use. In the general settings for each content instance on your site, there is an option called "Make Available for MyPage". Content instances that have this enabled will be available for users to add to their custom MyPage pages.</p>
