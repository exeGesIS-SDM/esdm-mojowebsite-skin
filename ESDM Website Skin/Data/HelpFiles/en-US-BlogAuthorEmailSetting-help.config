<p>If "Notify me when someone posts a comment" is checked in the Comment System section of settings, the comment notification will be sent to the email address specified in the Author Email setting in addition to the email address on the user account of the user who posted the blog post. This allows a global email to receive notification no matter who posts. Note that this setting only applies to using the internal comment system, external comment systems such as Disqus and IntenseDebate provide their own notifications.</p>
