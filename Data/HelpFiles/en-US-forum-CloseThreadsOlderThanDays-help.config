<p>You can close threads automatically after the number of days specified in this setting. Or with the value -1 the thread will never be closed.</p>

<p>Note that moderators (users with edit permission on the page or the feature instance) can still edit or make new posts on threads that are closed or locked but other users cannot. By putting in a high number like 365, you can prevent new posts on threads older than 1 year for example.</p>
