<p>How frequently the page is likely to change. This value provides general information to search engines and may not correlate exactly to how often they crawl the page. Valid values are:<br />
<br />
* always<br />
* hourly<br />
* daily<br />
* weekly<br />
* monthly<br />
* yearly<br />
* never<br />
<br />
The value &quot;always&quot; should be used to describe documents that change each time they are accessed. The value &quot;never&quot; should be used to describe archived URLs.<br />
<br />
Please note that the value of this tag is considered a hint and not a command. Even though search engine crawlers consider this information when making decisions, they may crawl pages marked &quot;hourly&quot; less frequently than that, and they may crawl pages marked &quot;yearly&quot; more frequently than that. It is also likely that crawlers will periodically crawl pages marked &quot;never&quot; so that they can handle unexpected changes to those pages.</p>

<p>Note: This site has a built in Site Map generator that supports Site Map Protocol, used by Google and other search engines to allow you to submit your site for indexing. You can submit your site map to Google using <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=sitemaps&amp;passive=true&amp;nui=1&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fsiteoverview&amp;followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fsiteoverview">Google Webmaster Tools</a>. The Site Map generator page is in the root of the site and named SiteMap.ashx, so you would submit the url to your site map as http://yoursitesiteurl/SiteMap.ashx. Of course search engnes can only crawl your public pages. Pages protected by roles will not be included in the site map and cannot be crawled. Also if your site is an intranet, that is, if your site is running on a local network and not on the internet, then no search engine can crawl your site.</p>
<p>If you want to track your web traffic, we recommend that you sign up for the free <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service. You can put a small bit of javascript in the layout.master file of your <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com/creatingskins.aspx">site skin</a> and Google will track traffic to all of the pages in your site and provide very sophisticated reporting.</p>
