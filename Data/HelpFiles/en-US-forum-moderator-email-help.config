<p>If you are requiring moderation before post notification messages are sent by email, you need to provide at least one moderator email address to notify when a new post is waiting for approval to send to subscribers. You can enter a comma separate list of email addresses to for multiple moderators. Make sure those users are either in the edit roles for the page or module or are in the moderator roles for the forum, otherwise they will get notification but will not be able to approve or reject posts for notification to subscribers.</p>
