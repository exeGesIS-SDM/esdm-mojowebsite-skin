<p>In some situations you may not want to allow users to change the name on their account. For example if you build an eccomerce site you may not want purchase history to suddenly have a different name attached to it. Not allowing this can help prevent fraud in some situations. Use your own judgement whether to allow this.</p>
<p>If your site is configured to use LDAP authentication (without the UseLDAPFallbackAuthentication key set to true), this setting will not be available.</p>
