<p>By default forum post notification emails will be sent using the default email from address and alias defined in Site Settings. However, it is a good practice to use different from addresses for different categories of email. The alias is just a name that is related to the from address. For example you might decide to use forum-mailer@yourdomain.com as the from address and "your site forums" as the alias.</p>
