	Selective publishing allows you to subscribe to a lot of feeds and then pick and choose only those few posts you want to include in the display or aggregate feed. This might be useful for example to subscribe to a lot of technology bogs and only post in your feed the really interesting or high quality posts. This way you are providing some value added with editorial judgement and reducing a lot of information to the most relevant to you and your audience.</p>
