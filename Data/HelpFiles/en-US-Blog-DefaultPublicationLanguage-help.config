<p>When the Google News Settings tab is enabled in the edit page there is a per post setting for the language of the article. The value you enter here will be used to pre-populate it for new posts but you could override it per post for example if some posts are not in the same language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be an <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">ISO 639 Language Code (either 2 or 3 letters)</a>. Exception: For Chinese, please use zh-cn for Simplified Chinese or zh-tw for Traditional Chinese.</p>
