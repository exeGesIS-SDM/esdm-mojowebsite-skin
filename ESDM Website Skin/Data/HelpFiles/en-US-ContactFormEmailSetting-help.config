<p>
	You can enter a single email address or multiple email addresses separated by commas and each email address will receive notification of form submissions.</p>
<p>
	If you want the user to be able to choose from a list of recipients, then separate the email addresses by pipes like this:</p>
<p>
	sales@yourdomain.com|support@yourdomain.com|billing@yourdomain.com</p>
<p>
	If you don&#39;t want to show the email addresses, you can enter aliases in the alias setting also separated by pipes. So for example, you could put this for the aliases corresponding to the email addresses shown above:</p>
<p>
	Sales Department|Technical Suport|Billing</p>
<p>
	The user will see a drop down list with those aliases displayed instead of a drop down with the email addresses.</p>
<p>
	You can even use comma separated email addresses in between pipes. So, for example, suppose for Technical Support you want 2 addresses to receive the submissions, you can add them separated by commas like this:</p>
<p>
	sales@yourdomain.com|supportperson1@yourdomain.com,supportperson2@yourdomain.com|billing@yourdomain.com</p>
