<p>There is a per post/article checkbox in the edit page for including the headline image in the auto-generated excerpt when excerpts are enabled either for the post list or the RSS feed. This checkbox determines whether the per post checkbox is checked by default or not.</p>
<p>Note that this only affects auto-generated excerpts, if you are creating the excerpts manually then this checkbox has no effect, instead you should just include the image within the manually edited excerpt.</p>
