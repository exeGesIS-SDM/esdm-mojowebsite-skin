<p>
	You can display feeds as a calendar by enabling this setting. This is useful for example if you have Event Calendar Pro which exposes events as an RSS feed, you can show a mini calendar on your home page for example with links to the event details using the calendar view of the Feed Manager and consuming the feed from Event Calendar Pro.</p>
<p>
	Note that many of the other settings are specific to the regular list view and are not applicable when Calendar view is enabled.</p>
