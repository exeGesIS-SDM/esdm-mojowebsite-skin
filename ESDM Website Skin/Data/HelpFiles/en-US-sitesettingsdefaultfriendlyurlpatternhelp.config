This setting determines the pattern to use when suggesting friendly urls for new pages.<br />
<br />
On Windows this will need to end with a .aspx but on linux depending on your configuration it might not require a file extension at all.<br />
Like Windows ~/somepage.aspx<br />
Linux/mono ~/somepage<br />
<br />
Note that in order for this to work on linux/mono without the .aspx you must make mono the handler for all files in the site directory.<br />
<br />
The safest setting to use is the &quot;PageName.aspx&quot; pattern.
