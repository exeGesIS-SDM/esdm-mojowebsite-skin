<p>Database Authentication is the primary default method for users to register and sign in to your site unless you are using LDAP or Windows Authentication.</p>
<p>Check the Disable Database Authentication box if you only want to use Windows Live and/or OpenID Authentication. Make sure at least one of those is enabled first or no-one will be able to sign in or register.</p>
<p>This setting has no effect when using LDAP or Windows Authentication.</p>
