<p>The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0. This value has no effect on your pages compared to pages on other sites, and only lets the search engines know which of your pages you deem most important so they can order the crawl of your pages in the way you would most like.<br />
<br />
The default priority of a page is 0.5.<br />
<br />
Please note that the priority you assign to a page has no influence on the position of your URLs in a search engine's result pages. Search engines use this information when selecting between URLs on the same site, so you can use this tag to increase the likelihood that your more important pages are present in a search index.<br />
<br />
Also, please note that assigning a high priority to all of the URLs on your site will not help you. Since the priority is relative, it is only used to select between URLs on your site; the priority of your pages will not be compared to the priority of pages on other sites.</p>

<p>Note: This site has a built in Site Map generator that supports Site Map Protocol, used by Google and other search engines to allow you to submit your site for indexing. You can submit your site map to Google using <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=sitemaps&amp;passive=true&amp;nui=1&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fsiteoverview&amp;followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fsiteoverview">Google Webmaster Tools</a>. The Site Map generator page is in the root of the site and named SiteMap.ashx, so you would submit the url to your site map as http://yoursitesiteurl/SiteMap.ashx. Of course search engnes can only crawl your public pages. Pages protected by roles will not be included in the site map and cannot be crawled. Also if your site is an intranet, that is, if your site is running on a local network and not on the internet, then no search engine can crawl your site.</p>
<p>If you want to track your web traffic, we recommend that you sign up for the free <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service. You can put a small bit of javascript in the layout.master file of your <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com/creatingskins.aspx">site skin</a> and Google will track traffic to all of the pages in your site and provide very sophisticated reporting.</p>
