<p>This setting, &quot;Password Attempt Window in Minutes&quot;, is used in conjunction with the setting &quot;Max Invalid Password Attempts&quot;.</p>
<p>If the user tries to login with an incorrect password too many times within the specified time window, the user account will be locked. So for example with the default settings, if the user tries to login more than 5 times in 5 minutes without providing the correct password the user account will be locked.</p>
