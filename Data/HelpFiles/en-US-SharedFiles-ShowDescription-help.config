	The description is not shown by default because it is often used simply to make file content indexable in the search index. For example, since we don&#39;t have an easy way to index file content from PDF files or Word documents, it is possible to paste the text content from those files into the description so the content can be indexed in the search engine and the file can be found easily in search results.</p>

	Showing the full file content in this case would be ugly, therefore description is not shown by default. However, if you are only using brief descriptions, you may want to show them.</p>
