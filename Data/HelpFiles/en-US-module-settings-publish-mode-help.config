	This setting works in conjunction with the Mobile Skin setting from Site Settings. When a mobile phone device such as iPhone, Android, or Windows 7 Phone is detected and when using the Mobile Skin, you can leave out a content instance by choosing Web Only for the publish mode. Conversely, if you make a different version of the content that is optimized for mobile you could set the content to Mobile Only and then it will only be shown when a mobile device is using the mobile skin.</p>
