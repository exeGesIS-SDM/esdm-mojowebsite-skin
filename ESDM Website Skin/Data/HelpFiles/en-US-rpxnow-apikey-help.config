<p>Janrain Engage is a service that makes it easy for users to sign in or register on your site using an existing account from Google, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter and others without having to use a new password. By reducing the barriers for users, it can increase site registration and participation. For more information visit the <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/engage">Janrain Engage</a>Â site.</p>
<p>If you already have a Janrain Engage account for this site from rpxnow.com, you should enter the API key and then click the Setup Janrain Engage button.</p>
<p>If you don't yet have an account, leave all fields blank and click the Setup RPX button. You will be redirected to RPXnow.com and after completing the account setup, RPXnow.com will redirect you back here and the settings will be updated automatically.</p>
<p>Note that while the Janrain Engage service also uses Open ID, disabling Open ID does not disable Janrain Engage. Janrain Engage is enabled by adding the Janrain Engage API key and disabled by removing it.</p>
