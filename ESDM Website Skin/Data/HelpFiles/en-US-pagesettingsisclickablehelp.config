	For dynamic menus like the jQuery Superfish menu used in some skins, it can be handy to makesome pages not clickable if they are really just a container for other. pages. You can mark a page as unclickable here, but keep in mind this only works well with certain kinds of menus. It does not work at all with TreeView menus for example. Note that if you make a page unclickable, then the only way to get to page settings for the page is from Administration &gt; Add/Edit Pages where you can select the page then click the wrench icon to get to settings.</p>
