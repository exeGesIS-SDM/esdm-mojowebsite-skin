<p>Originally this feature was designed for use with FTP, you would FTP the folders with images up to your site and just point to the folder where you would like the gallery to read its photos from. Later we added bulk upload so if a user has permission to choose the folder and upload images that requires quite a lot of trust. So this setting makes it possible to disallow the editing user to change the folder in case you want to let him upload to a specific location but nowhere else then you would un-check this so the user cannot change the folder.</p>
