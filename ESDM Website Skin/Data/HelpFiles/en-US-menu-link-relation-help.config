<p>This setting allows you to set the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_a_rel.asp" target="_blank">rel property on the html menu link</a> for this page. Generally you should leave this blank unless you are very sure of the reason you are populating it. Note that this property is only used in newer skins that use the FlexMenu. Older menus will not use this setting at all.</p>
