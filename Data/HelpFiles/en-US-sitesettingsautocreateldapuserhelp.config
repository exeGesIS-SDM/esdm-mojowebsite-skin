<p>Enable this box to have mojoPortal automatically create a user record in the database upon a successful LDAP authentication. Users will be created with a strong, unguessable random password. If you are authenticating against a true LDAP server (not Active Directory), it will attempt to use "givenName" and "sn" for the first name and last name in the display name field, respectively. If it is unable to select those keys, or you are using Active Directory, the user is created with login ID ("cn") as the display name.</p>
