<p>The Show Page Left Content and Show Page Right Content settings were added based on user requests. The blog module lives on a page in the content system and each post also has its own page at it own url. On the page containing the blog module you may have other content such as advertisements on the left or right side of the page. Checking these boxes makes it possible to show that content on the post specific pages.</p>
