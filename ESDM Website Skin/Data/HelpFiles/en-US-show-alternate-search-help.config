<p>
	If you use the default internal site search, you can enable links for the configured alternate search engines so that if the user doesn't find what they are looking for with the internal search, they can try searching the site with Bing or Google. This setting only applies if you have entered a valid Bing appId or a valid Google Custom Search id.</p>
