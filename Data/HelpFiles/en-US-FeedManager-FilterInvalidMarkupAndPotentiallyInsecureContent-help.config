	In general it is considered bad security practice to trust content from external feeds. You really have no control over the content coming into be displayed on your site if it comes from a feed. Enable this setting to block potentially risky content such as javascript or rich media that may potentially contain malicious content.</p>
<p>
	Of course there is often a trade off between security and user experience. Use your own judgement whether to trust the content in feeds you consume.</p>
