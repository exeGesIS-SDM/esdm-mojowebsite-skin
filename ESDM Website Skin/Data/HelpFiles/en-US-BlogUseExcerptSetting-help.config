	Each blog post has its own url where the full post is visible. There is also a post list that can show a specified number of recent posts according to the &nbsp;"Entries To Show" setting. In some cases you may prefer to show only an excerpt of the full post in the blog module with a link to the full post. Check this box to enable showing excerpts in the post list instead of full posts.</p>
