	Most feeds contain lists of things that have already happened like blog posts or news stories. By default they are shown from newest to oldest in descending order since that is the natural sort of the data in most feeds.</p>
<p>
	However, there are exceptions such as when you consume the feed from Event Calendar Pro for example, you are getting items with future dates, i.e. events that are coming up rather than events that already happened. In this case when using the default list view you may want to sort the item in ascending order.</p>
