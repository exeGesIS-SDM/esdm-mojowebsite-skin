<p>This only applies to features that support content versioning. If this is checked, then features that do support content versioning will keep a history of every change. This setting overrides any similar setting at the feature instance level so that an administrator can force keeping a history.</p>
<p>Content versioning can be forced on at an even higher level for <strong>all</strong> of your sites by placing the following key in your user.config file:</p>
<p>&lt;add key="EnforceContentVersioningGlobally" value="true" /&gt;</p>
<p>If this key is set, the choice here will appear checked and greyed out.</p>
