<p>Generally you should leave "Use extra clear type corrections" checked as true so that all clear type corrections can be used to smooth the contents of the slides. However depending on your skin design, sometimes you can get the undesirable page background color as the slide background color in Internet Explorer when this is enabled. In this case you can set this to false to disable the extra corrections and this will eliminate the background color. However clear type corrections may be slightly noticeable as the text may look a little grainy for a second before it is corrected by the main clear type corrections.</p>
