<p>The Headline Image is primarily used for the Google News Sitemap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A secondary use of this image is that it can be included in the auto-generated excerpt when using excerpts in the post list or in the RSS feed.</p>
<p>If you check this box, the headline image will be included in the auto-generated excerpt that is created if the excerpt on the blog post/news article is empty. If you are manually typing in your own excerpt then it will not automatically include this image, but you can browse to and include any image you like from the editor if you are manually typing it.</p>
