<p>When hosting multiple sites using one installation of mojoPortal, host names can be used to determine which site is rendered by mappng host names to the site id.</p>
<p>Any host names that are not specified for other sites will be resolved to the root site which typically has the site id 1.</p>
<p>It is only neccessary to specify host names for child sites since any other host name will always map to the root site.</p>
