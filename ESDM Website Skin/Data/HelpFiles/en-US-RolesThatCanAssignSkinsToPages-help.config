<p>
	When per page skins are enabled, a drop down list of skins appears in page settings. Users who can edit the page are not allowed by default to set the skin for the page except for Administrators and Content Administrators. You can enable additional roles here that can assign a skin to a page and the drop down list will be enabled for those users. So in effect users must have both page edit permissions and permission to assign a skin in order to be able to change the skin used on a page.</p>
