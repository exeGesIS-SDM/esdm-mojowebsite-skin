	You need to enter your Flickr User ID here, note that it is not the same as your user name. You can find your user id in the url if you visit your own photo stream on Flickr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="Flickr User ID shown in the url" src="/Data/HelpFiles/flickr-user-url.gif" style="width: 410px; height: 59px; " /></p>
