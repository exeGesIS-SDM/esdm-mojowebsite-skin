<p>
	On Windows servers with IIS 6 or lower, if your Friendly Url does not end with .aspx you must create a folder with the same name as your friendly url and add an empty text file named Default.aspx to the folder.</p>
<p>
	On IIS 7 and above it is possible to configure extensionless urls, but in IIS 6 this would require other techniques like using a 3rd party ISAP filter.</p>
