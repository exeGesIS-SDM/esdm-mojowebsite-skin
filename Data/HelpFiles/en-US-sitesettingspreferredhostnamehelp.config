<p>Use this setting in a case where multiple host names map to your site, and you want to force a particular one.<br /> For example, if you have an SSL certificate matched to www.yoursite.com, you would want to force URLs coming in on http://yoursite.com to http://www.yoursite.com.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">NOTE: If you don't have a reason to set this, leave it blank. If you put an incorrect host name here it can make your site completely inaccessible, and you would have to correct the problem directly in the database.</span></p>
