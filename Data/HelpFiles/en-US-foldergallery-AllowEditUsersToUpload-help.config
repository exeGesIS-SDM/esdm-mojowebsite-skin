<p>Check this box if you would like edit users to be able upload images. Note that if they can also choose the folder for the gallery that gives them quite a lot of freedom &nbsp;because they can change folders and upload files in whatever current folder they configure. In some case you may want to only allow a user to choose from existing folders and images, so you can leave this un-checked to support that. Alternatively you might limit them from setting the folder and only allow them to upload in a specific folder.</p>
