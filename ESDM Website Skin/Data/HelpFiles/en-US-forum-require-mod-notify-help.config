<p>This is useful if you are including the posted message in the notification email. If someone posts a spam forum message and then the forums sends that message to subscribers it can hurt the reputation of your email sender. By checking this box, notification will only be sent to the forum moderator email addresses listed below and the moderator can click a button to send the message to the subscribers if he approves it or he can mark it as sent to prevent it from being sent.</p>
