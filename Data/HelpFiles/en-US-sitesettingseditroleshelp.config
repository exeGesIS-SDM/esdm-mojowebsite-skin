	When using Related Sites Mode, all sites in an installation use the same set of users and roles. Therefore a user in the Content Administrators &nbsp;role is a Content Administrator of all sites. Site Editor roles allow you to specify roles that can edit a single site within a multi site installation using related sites mode without making the user a Content Administrator in all sites. Users in these roles will effectively have Content Administrator permissions in a single site whereas if you add them to the Content Administrators role they would have permissions in all sites.</p>
