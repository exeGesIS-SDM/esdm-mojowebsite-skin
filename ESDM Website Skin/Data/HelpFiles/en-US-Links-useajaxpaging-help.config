	Ajax paging allows you to page through the list without changing the url of the page. It is useful for when the list is in a side panel or if you just prefer it to not change the url.</p>
<p>
	However, ajax paging is less SEO (Search Engine Optimization) friendly because the urls for the different pages of the list cannot be indexed separately since there is only the url of the page. By disabling the ajax&nbsp;paging, when a user clicks a pager link it goes to a different url (ViewList.aspx) where the list will always be shown in the center of the page regardless of whether&nbsp;it was in the center of the CMS page. This means each page of the list can be indexed separately by search bots.</p>
<p>
	Since you can optionally show side content from the CMS page on the ViewList page, it can seem like a seemless experience for the user if the list is in the center column of the CMS page. In the case the ViewList page layout will be pretty much the same as the CMS page.</p>
