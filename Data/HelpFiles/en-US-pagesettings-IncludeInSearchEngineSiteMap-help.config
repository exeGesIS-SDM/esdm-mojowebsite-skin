<p>Normally you would want to leave this checked so that the page is listed in the search engine site map. However, if there are any pages in your site map that merely serve as links to external sites (ie you put a fully qualified url to an external page as the url for the page like http://www.someothersite.com), those links in your site map can cause google to reject you site map. In those cases you should uncheck this.</p>
<p>Pages protected by roles will not be included in the search engine site map, so this setting does not apply in those cases.</p>
