	By default, products are indexed into the site search, if you also want to index the text content of the Offers and return links to offer detail pages, you can check this box. However this will lead to search results showing both product and offer pages in the results. If you are using the store in a product centric way with product grouping in the product list it may be best to leave this unchecked so that only product pages are returned in search results. If you are using it in an offer centric way with grouping by offer then you probably want to enable indexing the offers.</p>
