<p>
	By default users are able to edit/update their own posts after they initially make the post. This setting limits how long they are allowed to edit a specific post. If you put 0 then users will not be able to edit/update their existing posts at all. If you put -1 then there is no limit to how long after the initial post that a user may edit his own posts. The default value of 60 means that after one hour the user cannot edit the post any further.</p>
<p>
	Note that Administrators or users with edit permissions on the page or forums can edit any post and there is no time limit.</p>
