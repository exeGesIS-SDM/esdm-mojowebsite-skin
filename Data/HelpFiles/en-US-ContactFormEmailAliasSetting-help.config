<p>If you are using multiple email addresses separated by pipes, you can enter aliases here so that the user does not see the actual email addresses. For example:</p>
<p>Sales Department|Technical Suport|Billing</p>
<p>The user will see a drop-down list with those aliases displayed instead of a drop down containing email addresses.</p>
<p>Note that if there is only one email address entered, the recipient drop-down list (and alias entered here) will not be shown on the form.</p>
