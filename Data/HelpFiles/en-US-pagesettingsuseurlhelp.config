<p>&#160;You generally will want to use friendly urls for your pages so it is recommended to keep this checked. If unchecked, the page will have an url like /Default.aspx?pageid=x where x is the id of the page. Its much friendlier to use urls that reflect the content of the page. A good url is auto suggested based on the page title.</p>
