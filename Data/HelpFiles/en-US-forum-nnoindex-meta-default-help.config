<p>If you are not including new posts in the google site map by default because most posts have no SEO value, you may also want to check this box so that new posts also get the NOINDEX meta setting applied by default. This only affects the default value used at the time when a new post is made. You can add or remove the NOINDEX meta from any given thread using the thread edit page.</p>
