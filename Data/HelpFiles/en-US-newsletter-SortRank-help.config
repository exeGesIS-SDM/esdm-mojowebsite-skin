<p>If you configure multiple newsletters for your site the Sort Rank determines how they are sorted in the list. Lower numbers sort lower than higher numbers. Keep in mind that if you do not show the list of newsletters on the Newsletter Sign Up form, then subscribers will only be subscribed to the default newsletter which is the news letter with the lowest sort rank or the first newsletter in the list. The list is sorted by Sort Rank and Title.</p>
