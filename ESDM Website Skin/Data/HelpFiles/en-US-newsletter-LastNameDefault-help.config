<div>
	When using the #lastname# token in the newsletter, for site members the token will be replaced by the last name from the user profile if populated otherwise if first name is populated it will be replaced by an empty string.</div>
<div>

<div>
	For non site members will be replaced by the Last Name Token Default setting on the newsletter definition or empty string if not populated.</div>
<div>

<div>
	So, for non site members one could put "Valued Customer" for the first and last name defaults and these would not be used for site member since we can at least be sure of a display name even when first and last name are not populated.</div>
