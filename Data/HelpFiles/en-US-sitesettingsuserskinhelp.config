<p>
	If you would like users to be able to specify the skin they use to display your site, check this box. The skin selection drop-down will appear in their user profile.</p>
<p>
	Before enabling this, be sure to evaluate each of the skins that are located under ~/Data/Sites/[SiteID]/Skins, and make sure that your site displays correctly when using them. To remove a skin from the list of available choices here and in the user profile, you can delete the corresponding directory under ~/Data/Sites/[SiteID]/Skins.</p>
<p>
	Note also that even when user specific skins are disabled, users in roles allowed to manage skins can still use a user specific skin. This makes it possible for a user with the ability to edit skins to work on a skin that is not active for the rest of the site.</p>
