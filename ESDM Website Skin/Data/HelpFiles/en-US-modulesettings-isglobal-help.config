<p>
	For features that support use of the same instance on multiple pages, you can mark the instance as &quot;Global&quot; and then it will show up on the dialog window from the &quot;Edit This Page&quot; (PageLayout.aspx) page so it is easier to add it to existing pages.</p>
<p>
	Once a feature instance is marked as global, it can only be edited by users in edit roles attached directly to the feature instance, it will not be based on page edit roles. The ideas is that just because a user is able to add global content to a page that they have edit permissions on does not mean the user should be able to edit that global content.</p>
<p>
	Administrators and Content Administrators can edit any content so you do not need to explicitly add those roles to the edit permissions.</p>
