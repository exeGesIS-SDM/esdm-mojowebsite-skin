<p>When using metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core, it is recommendedÂ to specify the profile within the head tag of the HTML document. For example, using Dublin Core metadata you would enter:</p>
<p>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/</p>
<p>and that would be added to the head tag of all pages on your site like this:</p>
<p>&lt;head profile="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/"&gt;</p>
<p>Note that if you are using multiple vocabularies, you can enter all of them here, separated by white space.</p>
<p>Metadata is added on Page Settings.</p>
<p>For more information about using Dublin Core metadata see the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/" target="_blank">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a> page.</p>
