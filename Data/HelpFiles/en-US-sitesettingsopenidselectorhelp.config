<p>This setting is for enabling an ID Selector for OpenID. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.idselector.com/">https://www.idselector.com/</a></p>
<p>When you sign up they will generate a script for you that looks something like this:</p>
<p>&lt;!-- BEGIN ID SELECTOR --&gt;<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; id=&quot;__openidselector&quot; src=&quot;https://www.idselector.com/selector/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- END ID SELECTOR --&gt;</p>
<p>The part represented by xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx will be your ID Selector code, it will be a long string of numbers and letters. Only enter the code here, do not enter the whole script they give you.</p>
