<p>To link to external pages, use fully qualified Urls like: http://www.google.com<br />
<br />
To create a friendly url to this internal page, enter the Url in the format ~/somepagenamewithnospacesinit.aspx</p>
<p>You should NOT try to reflect a folder structure in the Url. That is don't add extra "/" characters to the url. The system is not designed to reflect the site hierarchy in the url, in fact just the oppposite. By not reflecting the site hierarchy on the Url, it gives us freedom to move pages around in the hierarchy without ever breaking an Url. We recommend you use short urls that give an idea of the page content not its location. In a content management system, pages don't really correspond to physical files with locations on disk. Pages are created dynamically from the database content.<br />
<br />
When you enter a Page Name above, it will auto suggest a friendly url that does not already exist.<br />
&#160;<br />
(Note: if your language uses non-English letters the administrator may disable the auto suggest Url feature as it may not always work as well with non English characters.)<br />
<br />
To use the Url, you must also check the Use Url checkbox.</p>
