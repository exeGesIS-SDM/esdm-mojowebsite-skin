<p>Enabling this setting will change the system authentication method from the built-in authentication to LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).</p>
<p>If you would like the system to first attempt to authenticate using mojoPortal's own authentication, then fall back to LDAP if internal authentication fails, check this box <strong>and</strong> set the following key in user.config or web.config:</p>
<p>&lt;add key="UseLDAPFallbackAuthentication" value="true" /&gt;</p>
