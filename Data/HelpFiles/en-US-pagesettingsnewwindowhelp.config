<p>&#160;It is recommended not to open pages in a new window unless you have a real good reason for doing so. Generally it is considered a better user experience if the user remains in control. If pages open in new windows unexpectedly it can be disconcerting for users. If a user wants to open a page in a new window, all browsers support this by right clicking a link, so its best to leave that up to the user.</p>
