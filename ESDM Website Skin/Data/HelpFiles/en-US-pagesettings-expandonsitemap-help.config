<p>If checked and if the page has child pages, then the child pages will be expanded, or if unchecked they will be collapsed on the Treeview menu on the Site Map page.&#160;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Un-checking&#160;this setting only works if your Site Map is configured to show the expand and collapse nodes in the theme.skin file of your skin like this:</p>
<p>&lt;portal:mojoTreeView runat="server" SkinID="SiteMapPage"<br />
ShowExpandCollapse="true"<br />
/&gt;</p>
<p>If that setting is false it does not apply and the site map is always fully expanded. In most skins it is false by default which makes the site map fully expanded. For small to mid size sites, it is probably best to leave the entire site map expanded, however if your site has a very large hierarchy (hundreds or thousands of pages for example) it can be beneficial to not have the site map fully expanded.</p>
