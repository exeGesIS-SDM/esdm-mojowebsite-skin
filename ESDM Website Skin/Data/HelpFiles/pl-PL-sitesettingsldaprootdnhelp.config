For Active Directory an Example Root DN is:<br />
CN=Users,DC=mylocaldomain,DC=local<br />
<br />
Something like this would work for an AD setup for mylocaldomain.local, as long as the users exist in CN=Users. Something like this is fairly common in AD standard setup but if you are using something like Small Business Server its much more complicated the way it ocnfigures AD and the root dn for users is harder to figure out.<br />
<br />
The format will depend entirely on how your active directory is configured.<br />
<br />
For OpenLDAP I had it working with settings like this:<br />
ou=people,dc=shire,dc=home<br />
