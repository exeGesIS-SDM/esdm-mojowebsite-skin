	Generally we don't recommend requiring a user to fill out a captcha&nbsp;in order to sign into a site because it it a big inconvenience and may discourage participation in your site. However for some sites with very high security requirements we do make it possible to use a captcha on the login page. Note however it is only used for the standard login, it is not used for Open ID or Windows Live or RPX&nbsp;authentication.</p>
