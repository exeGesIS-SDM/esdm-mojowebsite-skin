<p>
	There are a few supported token replacements that allow you to enter a token that will be replaced when the newsletter is sent to users. The most important token is the #unsubscribe# token which is required. The #unsubscribe# token will be replaced with an link to un-subscribe from the newsletter. It is required by anti spam laws to include such a link.</p>
<p>
	There are several optional tokens that are also supported.</p>
<p>
	#viewaswebpage#&nbsp;will be replaced with a link to view the newsletter as a web page (if Allow Archive View is Enabled on the Newsletter definition).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<div>
	#username#&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	will be replaced by the site member display name or the non member email address</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	#email#&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	will be replaced by the email address</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	#displayname#&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	will be replaced by the site member display name from the user profile</div>
<div>
	for non site members will be replaced by a default value from the newsletter definition Display Name Token Default setting or empty string if that is not populated</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	#firstname#&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	for site members only will be replaced by the first name from the user profile if populated else it will use the display name from the user profile</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	for non site members will be replaced by the First Name Token Default setting on the newsletter definition or empty string if not populated</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	#lastname#&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	for site members only will be replaced by the last name from the user profile if populated otherwise it will be replaced with an empty string</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	for non site members will be replaced by the Last Name Token Default setting on the newsletter definition or empty string if not populated</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	So, as an example, for non site members one could put Valued Customer for the first and last name defaults.</div>
<div>
	These would not be used for site member since we can at least be sure of a display name even when first and last name are not populated.</div>
