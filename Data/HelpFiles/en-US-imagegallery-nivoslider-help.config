<p><a href="http://nivo.dev7studios.com/">Nivo Slider</a> is a fancy jQuery Slider that can be used for a slide show of images. Note that to work correctly the images need to be all the same size. The other slide show settings do not apply to Nivo Slider, those only work with the standard <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox">colorbox</a> slide show.</p>
<p>Note also that when Nivo Slider is enabled no edit links will appear for the images (just as when using the Silverlight Slideshow), so if you need to edit existing images you'll need to temmporarily disable Nivo Slider.</p>
