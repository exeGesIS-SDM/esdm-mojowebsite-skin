	Select this if you want to require password reset instead of password recovery. You must un-check &quot;Allow Password Recovery&quot; or Recovery will be used when possible instead of reset. Password Reset is always used if password are hashed because hashed passwords by nature cannot be recovered.</p>

	If you un-check both Allow Password Recover&quot; and Allow Password Reset&quot; then users will not be able to recover or reset their passwords and would require help from an administrator if they forget their password.</p>

	If using only LDAP authentication then neither password recovery nor reset is possible.</p>
