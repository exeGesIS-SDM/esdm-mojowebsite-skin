	This feature is for advanced users who have knowledge of XML and XSLT. It is designed to use an XSL file to transform an XML data file into HTML. The XSL file must be specifically designed to work with the XML data file, you cannot just use arbitrary files.</p>

<p>
	You can either upload Xml and Xsl files and choose them from the available dropdown lists, or you can enter fully qualified urls for either the Xml or Xsl file or both. If values are entered for the Urls they take precedence and will be used instead of the dropdown items.</p>
<p>
	A malformed XML or XSL file can cause an error to happen in this feature. The error will be handled and logged in the system log under Administration &gt; System Log</p>
