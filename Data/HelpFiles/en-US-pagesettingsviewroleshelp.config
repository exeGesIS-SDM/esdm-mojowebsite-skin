<p>&#160;These are the roles that are allowed to view the page. The menu and site map are filtered based on roles. So if you have content that you want only some people to be able to see, you put those users in a role and protect the page by setting the view permissions so that onl;y that role can see it. Note however that Administrators and Content Administrators roles can see all content, so even if you uncheck Administrators and Content Administrators, they can alwasy see any page.</p>
