	This setting works in conjunction with the Mobile Skin setting from Site Settings. When a mobile phone device such as iPhone, Android, or Windows 7 Phone is detected and when using the Mobile Skin, you can leave out a page from the menu by choosing Web Only for the publish mode. Conversely, if you make a different version of the page that is optimized for mobile you could set the content to Mobile Only and then it will only be shown in the menu when a mobile device is using the mobile skin.</p>

	Note however that this setting is not a security setting, it is only intended to help you provide a better experience for mobile users. If the page is left out of the menu based on this setting, a user could still navigate directly to the page if he knows the url.&nbsp;</p>
