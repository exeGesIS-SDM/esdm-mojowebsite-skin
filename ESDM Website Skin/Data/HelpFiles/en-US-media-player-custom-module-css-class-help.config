<p>You can specify a custom CSS class that will be added to the outer wrapper div element, and this can be used to customize the style from CSS.</p>
<p>Note that there are 2 skins for the media player that are currently available, bluemonday and pinkflag. You can include one of these items in the style.config file of your skin:</p>
<p>&lt;file cssvpath="/Data/style/jplayer/allskins.css" imagebasevpath="/Data/style/jplayer/"&gt;none&lt;/file&gt;<br />&lt;!--<br />&lt;file cssvpath="/Data/style/jplayer/bluemonday/jplayer.blue.monday.css" imagebasevpath="/Data/style/jplayer/bluemonday/"&gt;none&lt;/file&gt;<br />&lt;file cssvpath="/Data/style/jplayer/pinkflag/jplayer.pink.flag.css" imagebasevpath="/Data/style/jplayer/pinkflag/"&gt;none&lt;/file&gt;<br />--&gt;</p>
<p>If you include the first one, it contains both of the skins and then you can specify which skin is used by setting this custom CSS class to either bluemonday or pinkflag. Or to reduce the total amount of CSS you can choose one of the other files and include only one of the skins for the media player.</p>
