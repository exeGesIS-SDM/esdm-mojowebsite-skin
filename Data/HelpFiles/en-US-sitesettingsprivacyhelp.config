<p>You should ideally create a page in your site with information about your privacy policies. We recommend you create the page using the url /privacy.aspx, but you can use something else or a localized version of that name. The privacy page can be optionally excluded from your menu and shown in the site map and/or using a link in the footer of your skin's layout.master file. The privacy URL is required for using Windows Live Services such as Windows Live Login and Windows Live Messenger web integration features.</p>
