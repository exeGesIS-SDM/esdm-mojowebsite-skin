<p>
	When not using&nbsp;ajax&nbsp;paging, a separate page is used for paging through the list. This setting allows you to show the same content on the right side of the list view page as is on the&nbsp;CMS&nbsp;page. It is useful when the list is in the center column and you want a&nbsp;seemless&nbsp;experience when paging through the list.</p>
