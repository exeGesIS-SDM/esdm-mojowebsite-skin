<p>By default the outbound RSS feed for the blog will include the full post. Readers may subscribe to your feed using Google Reader or any of a number of Blog Readers or Feed Aggregators. In some cases you may wish to only include an excerpt of your posts in the feed so that users would have to visit your site to see the full post. If you would rather have only an excerpt in your outbound feed then check this box.</p>
