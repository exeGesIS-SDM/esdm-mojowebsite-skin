	If Allow Password Recovery&quot; is checked and you are using either plain text or encrypted passwords then users will be able to recover their passwords by having it sent to them in email. If using Hashed passwords recovery is not possible so the recovery system will reset the password to a new random password and send it to the user.</p>
<p>
	If you un-check both Allow Password Recover&quot; and Allow Password Reset&quot; then users will not be able to recover or reset their passwords and would require help from an administrator if they forget their password.</p>
<p>
	If your site is configured to only use LDAP authentication then neither password recovery nor reset is possible.</p>
