<p>You can new roles to assist in securing pages or individual content.</p>
<p>Example: You have a page that you want all employees to be able to see but not other registered or anonymous users. You would create an Employees role, add the user accounts for each employee to that role, and finally you would set the security on the page to allow members of the Employees role to view it but not any other role.</p>
<p>(Note: The Administrators role always has full permissions to every page and content item, regardless of how the permissions are set.</p>
