<p>Correct cannonical urls are generated by default in mojoPortal, so generally you should leave this blank and let the cannonical url be determined automatically by the page url.</p>
<p>One exception to this rule is the home page of your site. If it is named Home it will typically have an url of http://yoursite/home.aspx, but the url http://yoursite/ serves the same content and you may wish to use that as the cannonical url. In that case you can enter it here.</p>
