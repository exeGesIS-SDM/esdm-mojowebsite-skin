<p>Enable this setting to turn on the Content Workflow system for your site. Currently Content Workflow is only recognized by the HTML feature. Enabling Content Workflow can serve several functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to edit content, but require that changes be approved by an editor before publishing.</li>
<li>Create a "draft" version of content that is visible only to members of the edit or draft edit roles, not the general public. This content can then be quickly published when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com/using-the-content-workflow-system.aspx" target="_blank">Content Workflow</a> documentation page.</p>
