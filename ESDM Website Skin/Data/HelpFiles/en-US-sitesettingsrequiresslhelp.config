<p>Enable this to use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for every page on your site. For performance reasons, this is generally not recommended unless all the content on your entire site is sensitive and needs to be encrypted when sent over the wire to each web browser.</p><p>Pages such as user profile and administrative pages will automatically use SSL if it is available, and content pages could be configured to require SSL on a case by case basis depending on whether they contain information that should be protected by encryption.</p>
