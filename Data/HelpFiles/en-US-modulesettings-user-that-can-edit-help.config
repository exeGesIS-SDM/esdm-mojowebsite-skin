<p>The primary way to grant edit permission is by user roles. Administrators can create a custom role, select the role as an allowed editing role and add the user to the role. However in some cases if you just want to allow one user to edit the content instance without adding him or her to a role that might also grant other editing privileges. You can just start typing in the user box to lookup a user by email or name, when you select the user his user id will be shown in the box to the right. If you save the user id, it will allow that user to edit the content instance. If you need to allow more than one user to edit then you should create an allowed edit role and add both users to the role.</p>
