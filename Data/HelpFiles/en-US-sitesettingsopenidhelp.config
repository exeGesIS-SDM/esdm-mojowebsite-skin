	<a href="http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> is a single Sign on solution for the Web. The benefit for users is that they only have to remember one set of login credentials that will work on all sites that support Open ID. Check this box to enable users to sign in to this site with their Open ID. Users can get a free Open ID account at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">MyOpenID.com</a>.</p>

	Note that while RPX service also uses Open ID, un-checking this does not disable RPX. RPX is enabled by adding the RPX API key and disabled by removing it.</p>
