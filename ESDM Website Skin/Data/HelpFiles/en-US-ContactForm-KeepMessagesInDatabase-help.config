	By default messages are kept in the database and you can view them using the view messages link near the title of the contact form. This way messages are preserved regardless of whether email is configured correctly for sending notification of contact form submissions. You can uncheck this if you do not want to keep the messages in the database. However it is recommended to test and make sure your email is configured correctly and you are receiving notifications of form submissions before you disable it. If email is not configured correctly or not working and you configure it to not keep the messages, then the message can be lost with no record of it ever being received.</p>
